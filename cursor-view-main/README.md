# Cursor View

Cursor View is a local tool to view, search, and export all your Cursor AI chat histories in one place. It works by scanning your local Cursor application data directories and extracting chat data from the SQLite databases.

**Privacy Note**: All data processing happens locally on your machine. No data is sent to any external servers.
